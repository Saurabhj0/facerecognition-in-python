# facerecognition-in-python
This Face Recognition System is built using OpenCV library function. 

My Face recognition project is simply divided into three parts.
1> Dataset creator : This is basically a datacollector which will collect the images of person which later use for prediction.
2> Trainer : Trainer file is used to train the ML model, Every time you add a new dataset you need to run this trainer code.
3> Detector or Recognisor: This is the final code which will predict the name of the person appear on the camera.

If some one want to share something or Add something new in this than i am very happy to hear from you guys...
